TODO

Separate index.js into global.js, index.js, and dropdown.js.
  - dropdown.js needs to be able to be called from $.getScript(), or included into dropdown.php, probably the latter.

x Implement jsPDF for printer page 
  - Doesn't retain style, come back to this at jspdf.php

search is being funky, overwrites dropdown extend/collapse button because of post.html() call, and also script functionality gets lost on reload
	- .customer.click might need added to a dropdown.js file and reloaded on search event

There's no proper check for duplicate name entry on submit. That must have been what 'nameCheck' was for, but it's been commented out.

o Default dates to use "today's date", 
  - and possibly add a new checkbox that says 'no date,' or 'none' that will void the date instead of it being based on 2014-01-01.

comment alt check/replacement is just a little too touchy

Customer Container needs restyled

If a checkbox is false, make sure to set the dates back to default 0000-00-00

still missing date for Title Work Ordered

o Radio buttons get a little messed up when there's nothing to go into them, add a default false value to them.

index.js
=====
All of those variables in index.js are going to be added to a JSON object array
Dropdown states should be conditional, rather than separate similar functions.

Major eventual reworks
===============
The dropdown will be rewritten in Javascript, which allows for seamless refreshes, and JSON; dropdown.close.click functionality could be changed from XML, which does work, into a real JSON file.

Logger
======
the following functions need to be logged

Customer Addition or Update
reset
removal
User log in/out
