TODO

Implement jsPDF for printer page

search is being funky, overwrites dropdown extend/collapse button because of post.html() call, and also script functionality gets lost on reload
- .customer.click might need added to a dropdown.js file and reloaded on search event

There's no proper check for duplicate name entry on submit. That must have been what 'nameCheck' was for, but it's been commented out.

Default dates to use "today's date", and possibly add a new checkbox that says 'no date,' or 'none' that will void the date instead of it being based on 2014-01-01.

comment alt check/replacement is just a little too touchy

Customer Container needs restyled

If a checkbox is false, make sure to set the dates back to default 0000-00-00

index.js
=====
All of those variables in index.js are going to be added to a JSON object array
Dropdown states should be conditional, rather than separate similar functions.

Major eventual reworks
===============
The dropdown will be rewritten in Javascript, which allows for seamless refreshes, and JSON; dropdown.close.click functionality could be changed from XML, which does work, into a real JSON file.
