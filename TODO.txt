TODO

Converge everything into a single list. This form is not two sections any more. Dates and check-boxes are of the same list now.

Remove
=====
x HMDA
x Has this loan been approved?
x Lock Date
x Expiration Date
x Will this loan be turned down in 3 days?
x Notice of adverse action

x redundancy on title work ordered & title work approved
x move title work ordered & title work approved to down below appraisal and still needs buttons like up top

index.js
=====
All of those variables in index.js are going to be added to a JSON object array
Dropdown states should be conditional, rather than separate similar functions.

Major eventual reworks
===============
The dropdown will be rewritten in Javascript, which allows for seamless refreshes, and JSON; dropdown.close.click functionality could be changed from XML, which does work, into a real JSON file.
