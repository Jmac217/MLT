index.js
=====
All of those variables in index.js are going to be added to a JSON object array
Dropdown states should be conditional, rather than separate similar functions.

Major eventual reworks
===============
The dropdown will be rewritten in Javascript, which allows for seamless refreshes, and JSON; dropdown.close.click functionality could be changed from XML, which does work, into a real JSON file.
